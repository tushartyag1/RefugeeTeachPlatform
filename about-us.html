        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are often charitable only once or twice a year, but refugees constrained by law are solely dependent on such funds at present. What they need is a more consistent, respectable, and stable stream of income.</p>
        <p><br>Over 1.5 billion people are learning a foreign language right now as we speak. In fact, millions of them pair up with native speakers to learn these languages, and this is stastically proven!</p>
        <p><br>Here at RefuTeach, we just bring you together.</p>
        <p><br>RefuTeach provides a platform for refugees to teach their native languages, creating sustainable income and helping others learn new languages from native speakers.</p>
        <p><br>Connecting cultures, languages, but most importantly people all across the globe.<br>With love, RefuTeach❤️</p>
